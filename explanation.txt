Algorithm explanation:
 Initialize variables rounds and found 
    (let rounds - number of rounds the three brothers can drink
     let found for checking how many glasses are the same size in a row)

 Set first(index= 0) element of array as last checked size (last_size)
 Start looping from the second element(index= 1)

 If last_size is equal to current element
    then 
        increment found and check if found is equal to two
            if found is equal to two 
                then the current element is the third equal in a row
                and we can remove those three from array

                    becuase I use splice, I removed previous two and current with glasses.splice(i - 2, 3)
                    after removing those three, I want to return 3 steps because of splice and one more in case that modified array 
                    creates another equal three right away 
                    ( i - 4 < 0 ? i = 0 : i -= 4) in code

                    set current as last_size and continue

If last_size is NOT equal to current element   
     then   
        reset found to zero 
        set current as last_size and continue
